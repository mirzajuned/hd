      This document is intended to provide you with information so that you can decide whether you should have a type of laser surgery called
      laser indirect ophthalmoscopy or LIO. You have the right to ask any questions you might have about the procedure before agreeing to have
      the ophthalmologist, or eye surgeon, perform it on your eye.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Indications for Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscopy :</h3>

      The eye functions much like a camera. The front of the eye contains the structures which focus the image and regulate the amount of light
      that enters the eye, similar to the lens and shutter of a camera. In the back of the eye is the retina, which functions like the film in the
      camera. Without film, a camera cannot take a picture, and without a functioning retina, the eye cannot see.
      LIO is done to laser the peripheral retina. It is used to treat peripheral retinal lesions like lattice degeneration or a retinal break, which may
      predispose your eyes to retinal detachment. LIO is also done to delimit peripheral detached retina to prevent its further progression. LIO
      can also be used for augmentation of pan-retinal photocoagulation where the peripheral retina cannot be lasered by using a slit lamp
      machine.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;"> Possible Benefits of Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscopy :</h3>

      Laser indirect ophthalmoscopy or LIO uses a laser to treat the peripheral retina so that it will form a strong adhesion of the retina with
      underlying layers, preventing the retina to detach, and avoiding a potentially blinding condition.
      To perform the procedure, the pupil of the eye is made bigger (dilated) with eye drops. The laser is aimed at the peripheral retina through
      the pupil with the help of an indirect ophthalmoscope. Since the laser treats the peripheral retina, some peripheral or side vision may be
      lost, and this may cause reduced night vision. This usually does not present a problem for most of the cases.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternatives to Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscopy :</h3>

      Cryotherapy has also been used to treat peripheral retinal lesions. Cryotherapy uses a probe placed against the outside of the eye to treat
      the peripheral retina by freezing it. Most ophthalmologists now treat the peripheral retina with a laser instead of cryotherapy.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks and Complications of Laser Indirect Ophthalmoscopy :</h3>

      When deciding whether or not to have surgery, the patient must weigh the possible risks of the surgery against the benefits the surgery is
      expected to produce. Laser surgery for peripheral retina has limited risks. While performing the surgery, structures of the eye can be
      damaged and cause complications, which may lead to loss of vision. Surgery or medications may be needed to treat these complications.
      In the majority of patients whose eyes were treated with LIO, the retina remained attached. While the goal of the surgery is prevent a retinal
      detachment and blindness, even with proper treatment, not all eyes respond to the treatment. New lesions of the retina may develop and
      regular retinal screening is required. For some the laser surgery may have to be repeated in order to completely treat the retinal lesion.
      Risks for LIO include, but are not limited to:
      <li> Failure to achieve the goal of surgery: even with treatment, retinal detachment may develop in few cases.</li>
      <li> Bleeding in the eye (vitreous hemorrhage)</li>
      <li> Elevated eye pressure (glaucoma)</li>
      <li> Decreased eye pressure (hypotony)</li>
      <li> Corneal burns (clear covering of the front of the eye)</li>
      <li> Damage to the iris (colored portion of the eye)</li>
      <li> Damage to the lens (cataract)</li>
      <li> Loss of vision or loss of the eye</li>
      <li> Loss of peripheral (side) vision</li>
      <li> Corneal clouding or scarring</li>
      <li> Decrease or loss of vision caused by loss of circulation to the vital tissues in the eye</li>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;"> Consent for Laser Surgery for ROP :</h3>

      The ophthalmologist has explained to me the problem with my eyes, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives to LIO surgery. Although it
      is impossible for the doctor to inform me of every possible complication that may occur, the doctor has answered all my questions to my
      satisfaction. I understand that there is no guarantee that the surgery will prevent blindness in my eye, and that the surgery may need to be
      repeated to effectively treat my condition.<br>
      In signing this informed consent for LIO, I am stating that I have been offered a copy and I fully understand the possible risks, benefits,
      and complications of the laser surgery.

      I declare that I have explained the nature and consequences of the procedure to be performed, and discussed the risks that particularly concern the patient.
      I have given the patient an opportunity to ask questions and I have answered these.
