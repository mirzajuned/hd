      I have been informed in my mother tongue that my right/ left eye may be harboring a disease which if not removed may result in loss of vision in the same eye and may lead to spread of the disease to other parts of the body and cause risk to my life and a painful blind eye.
      <br>
      I understand that the total contents of the eyeball will be removed and an artificial prosthesis may have to be implanted to maintain the shape of the eye. I also understand that I will have to wear prosthetic eye for cosmetic purpose after surgery.
      <br>I understand that in spite of the best efforts by the operating surgeons, there may be incomplete removal which may require additional surgery or treatment. I also understand that the other eye may be affected after surgery, which may require additional treatment.
      <br>I hereby authorize..........................................................and those he/ the institute may designate as staff, associates or assistants to perform surgery for removal of my right/left eye.<br>
      I understand that in spite of the best efforts by the operating surgeons, there may be incomplete removal which may require additional surgery or treatment.
      <br>It has been explained to me that during the course of treatment, unforeseen conditions may be revealed or encountered which may necessitate surgical and emergency procedures in addition to or different from those contemplated at the time of initial diagnosis. I, therefore, further request and authorize the above designated staff to perform such additional surgical or other procedures as they deem necessary or desirable.
      <br>I consent to the use of anesthesia and to use of anesthetics as may be deemed necessary or desirable.<br>
      I further consent to the administration of such drugs, infusions, plasma or blood transfusion or any other treatment or procedures deemed necessary.<br>
      I consent to the observing, photographing or televising of the procedure to be performed for medical, scientific or educational purpose provided my identity is not revealed by the pictures or by descriptive text accompanying them.
      <br>I have been given the opportunity to ask all/any questions and I have also been given the option to ask for any second opinion.
      <br>I am fully aware that the surgery is being performed in good faith and that no guarantee or assurance has been given as to the result that may be obtained.
      <br>Any tissues or parts surgically removed may be disposed off by the institution in accordance with customary practice.

      I declare that I have explained the nature and consequences of the procedure to be performed, and discussed the risks that particularly concern the patient.
