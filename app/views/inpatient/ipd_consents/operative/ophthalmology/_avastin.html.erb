      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Possible Benefits and “Off-Label” Status :</h3>

      Avastin TM was not initially developed to treat your eye condition. Based upon the results of clinical trials that demonstrated its safety and
      effectiveness, Avastin TM was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
      Once a device or medication is approved by the FDA, physicians may use it “off-label” for other purposes if they are well-informed about
      the product, base its use on firm scientific method and sound medical evidence, and maintain records of its use and effects. Ophthalmologists
      are using Avastin TM “off-label” to treat AMD and similar conditions since research indicates that VEGF is one of the causes for the growth
      of the abnormal vessels that cause these conditions. Some patients treated with Avastin TM had less fluid and more normal-appearing
      maculas, and their vision improved. Avastin TM is also used, therefore, to treat macular edema, or swelling of the macula. Recently, a
      medication similar in function and designed for intravitreal administration was approved by the FDA for the treatment of AMD.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Possible Limitations :</h3>

      The goal of treatment is to prevent further loss of vision. Although some patients have regained vision, the medication may not restore
      vision that has already been lost, and may not ultimately prevent further loss of vision caused by the disease.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternatives :</h3>

      You do not have to receive treatment for your condition, although without treatment, these diseases can lead to further vision loss and
      blindness, sometimes very quickly. Other forms of treatment are available. At present, there are three FDA-approved treatments for neovascular
      age-related macular degeneration. The first two are photodynamic therapy with a drug called Visudyne TM and injection into the eye of a drug
      called Macugen TM . The third medication, Lucentis TM is similar to Avastin TM . In addition to the FDA-approved medications, some
      ophthalmologists use intravitreal triamcinolone —”off-label” to treat eye conditions like yours.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Complications when Avastin TM is given to patients with cancer :</h3>

      When Avastin TM is given to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, some patients experienced gastrointestinal perforations or wound
      healing complications, hemorrhage, arterial thromboembolic events (such as stroke or heart attack), hypertension, proteinuria, and
      congestive heart failure. Patients who experienced these complications not only had metastatic colon cancer, but were also given 400
      times the dose you will be given, at more frequent intervals, and in a way (through an intravenous infusion) that spread the drug
      throughout their bodies.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risk when Avastin TM is given to treat patients with eye conditions :</h3>

      The risk of these complications for patients with eye conditions is low. Patients receiving Avastin TM for eye conditions are healthier than
      the cancer patients, and receive a significantly small dose, delivered only to the cavity of their eye. While there are no FDA-approved
      studies about the use of Avastin TM in the eye that prove it is safe and effective, Lucentis TM , a similar drug, was recently approved for AMD.
      One study of patients who received Avastin TM through an intravenous infusion reported only a mild elevation in blood pressure. Another
      study of patients treated like you will be with intravitreal Avastin TM did not have these elevations or the other serious problems seen in the
      patients with cancer. However, the benefits and risks of intravitreal Avastin TM for eye conditions are not yet fully known. In addition,
      whenever a medication is used in a large number of patients, a small number of coincidental life-threatening problems may occur that
      have no relationship to the treatment. For example, patients with diabetes are already at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes. If one
      of these patients being treated with Avastin TM suffers a heart attack or stroke, it may be caused by the diabetes and not the Avastin TM
      treatment.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Known risks of intravitreal eye injections :</h3>

      Your condition may not get better or may become worse. Any or all of these complications may cause decreased vision and/or have a possibility of causing blindness. Additional procedures may be needed to treat these complications. Possible complications and side
      effects of the procedure and administration of Avastin TM include but are not limited to retinal detachment, cataract formation, glaucoma,
      hypotony (reduced pressure in the eye), damage to the retina or cornea, and bleeding. There is also the possibility of an eye infection
      (endophthalmitis). Any of these rare complications may lead to severe, permanent loss of vision.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Patient Responsibilities :</h3>

      I will immediately contact my doctor if any of the following signs of infection or other complications develop : pain, blurry or decreased
      vision, sensitivity to light, redness of the eye, or discharge from the eye. I will keep all post-injection appointments so my doctor can check
      for complications.<br>
      Although the likelihood of serious complications affecting other organs of my body is low, I will immediately contact my physician if I
      experience abdominal pain associated with constipation & vomiting, abnormal bleeding, chest pain, severe headache, slurred speech, or
      weakness on one side of the body. As soon as possible, I will also notify the treating ophthalmologist of these problems.<br>
      I will inform any other surgeon that I am on a medication that needs to be stopped before I can have surgery.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;"> Patient Consent :</h3>

      The above explanation has been read by/to me. The nature of my eye condition has been explained to me and the proposed treatment has
      been described. The risks, benefits, alternatives, and limitations of the treatment have been discussed with me. All my questions have been
      answered.<br>
      I understand that Avastin TM was approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and has not been approved for the
      treatment of eye conditions. Nevertheless, I wish to be treated with Avastin TM , and I am willing to accept the potential risks that my
      physician has discussed with me. I hereby authorize the treating eye-surgeon to administer the intravitreal Avastin TM in my affected eye as
      needed. This consent will be valid until I revoke it or my condition changes to the point that the risks and benefits of this medication for
      me are significantly different.
