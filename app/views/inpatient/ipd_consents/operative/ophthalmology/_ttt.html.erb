      I hereby authorize Dr. ......................................................................................... to perform upon me Trans-Pupillary Thermotherapy in Right /
      Left eye for neovascular changes in the Macula (which is the vital region of the retina for clear central vision) caused by Age Related
      Macular Degeneration / Pathologic Mypia / other causes .......................................................................<br>
      Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) is a type of laser therapy designed for the treatment of sub retinal new-vessel formation especially
      when these new vessels involve the subfoveal region. These new vessels most commonly develop in i) Aging Macular Degeneration ii)
      Myopia, iii) Post inflammatory and iv) Idiopathic causes. TTT is also used in the treatment of certain tumours. When the fovea (the vital
      region of the retina for fine central reading and colour vision) is not involved, these vessels can be destroyed by laser photocoagulation.
      However there is also simultaneous destruction of the retinal cells overlying these abnormal new vessels. This loss of function of retinal
      cells is usually acceptable in other areas but not at the fovea. Hence the search for alternative therapies which can destroy these abnormal
      vessels without destroying the overlying foveal retinal cells. The various alternatives tried for this are:-<br>

      <li> Surgery : Results especially in Aging Macular Degeneration have been poor because in removing the membrane retinal pigment
      epithelial cells are also lost and vision usually does not improve. There is also a risk of significant vision loss if complications occur.</li>
      <li> Photodynamic Therapy : This is applicable only to certain specific types of new-vessels. The cost of treatment is very high because
      of high cost of dye. The treatment may need to be repeated depending on the progress seen on follow up examinations.</li>
      <li> Radiation - Results have not been encouraging.</li>
      <li> Anti-angiogenic factors :- Results have not been encouraging.</li>
      <li> Trans Pupillary Thermo Therapy :- Large spot of diode laser 810 nm with relatively low energy is applied to the area of new-vessels.
      Treatment results have been encouraging. About two-thirds of patients have stabilization of vision. A very small number may have
      actual improvement in vision. Some patients may experience reduction in central vision after the treatment. TTT treatment may
      need to be repeated depending on the progress seen on follow up examinations and fluorescein/indocyanine green angiograms.</li>
      For the laser treatment, local anaesthetic drops are put into the eye and a contact lens is used. After treatment you should not bend down,
      lift weight and you should sleep with head up with 2 pillows. For a few hours after the treatment, you will have some blurred vision because
      of the drops used to prepare your eye for the treatment. You should also wear dark sunglasses to protect your eye from the light. During this
      time, you must not drive any vehicles. You do not have to agree to have this therapy and, if you wish, we will continue to monitor your
      progress even if you choose not to try Transpupillary Thermotherapy (TTT).<br>
      After treatment, periodic re-examination is necessary to monitor the response to treatment and detect any changes in the status of the
      retinopathy, especially any change that would require additional treatment. I understand that it is the patientâ€™s responsibility to maintain
      follow up appointments necessary after laser treatment. I acknowledge that the nature and the purpose of this procedure, the risks
      involved, alternatives and the possible complications have been explained to me and that all my questions, if any, have been answered to
      my satisfaction. I am aware that the practice of medicine & surgery is not an exact science, and I acknowledge that no guarantee can be
      made as to the results that may be obtained. All this has been explained to me in the language I understand.<br>
      I have read, or had read to me, the above information, and I consent to treatment, recognizing the potential risks that are involved.

      I declare that I have explained the nature and consequences of the procedure to be performed, and discussed the risks that particularly concern the patient.
      I have given the patient an opportunity to ask questions and I have answered these.
