      This document is intended to provide you with information so that you can decide whether you should have Laser photocoagulation for
      diabetic retinopathy<br>
      You have the right to ask any questions you might have about the procedure before agreeing to have the ophthalmologist, or eye surgeon,
      perform it on your eye.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Indications for Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Retinopathy :</h3>
      The eye functions much like a camera. The front of the eye contains the structures which focus the image and regulate the amount of light
      that enters the eye, similar to the lens and shutter of a camera. In the back of the eye is the retina, which functions like the film in the
      camera. Without film, a camera cannot take a picture, and without a functioning retina, the eye cannot see.<br>
      Laser photocoagulation uses the heat from a laser to seal or destroy abnormal, leaking blood vessels in the retina. One of two approaches
      may be used when treating diabetic retinopathy:<br>
      <li> Focal photocoagulation. Focal treatment is used to seal specific leaking blood vessels in a small area of the retina, usually near the
      macula. The ophthalmologist identifies individual blood vessels for treatment and makes a limited number of laser burns to seal
      them off.</li>
      <li>  Scatter (pan-retinal) photocoagulation. Scatter treatment is used to slow the growth of new abnormal blood vessels that have
      developed over a wide area of the retina. The ophthalmologist may make hundreds of laser burns on the retina to stop the blood
      vessels from growing. The person may need two or more treatment sessions.</li>
      Laser photocoagulation is not painful. The injection of anesthetic may be uncomfortable, and you may feel a slight stinging sensation or
      see brief flashes of light when the laser is applied to your eye.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Possible Benefits of Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Retinopathy :</h3>

      Laser treatment may not restore vision that has already been lost. But when performed in a timely manner,
      <li>  Focal photocoagulation, which targets specific blood vessels, is effective in reducing the risk of vision loss in people with macular
      edema. It lowers the risk of moderate vision loss by 20% in people who have mild to moderate non-proliferative retinopathy. It may
      also help prevent progression to more severe retinopathy.</li>
      <li>  Scatter (pan-retinal) photocoagulation, which treats a wide area of the retina, reduces the risk for severe vision loss by 50% to 60%
      over 6 years in people with a high risk of vision loss. It reduces the risk of serious bleeding and progression of severe proliferative
      retinopathy and the need for surgery (vitrectomy) by 50% in people with type 2 diabetes and people age 40 and older with type 1
      diabetes who already have severe non-proliferative or mild proliferative retinopathy. Studies suggest that up to 90% of cases of legal
      blindness caused by proliferative retinopathy could be prevented by prompt scatter photocoagulation.</li>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;"> Risks and Complications of Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Retinopathy :</h3>

      Laser photocoagulation burns and destroys part of the retina and often results in some permanent vision loss. This is usually unavoidable.
      Treatment may cause mild loss of central vision, reduced night vision, and decreased ability to focus. Some people may lose some of their
      side (peripheral) vision. However, the vision loss caused by laser treatment is mild compared with the vision loss that may be caused by
      untreated retinopathy.<br>
      Rare complications of laser photocoagulation may cause severe vision loss. These include:
      <li>  Bleeding in the eye (vitreous hemorrhage).</li>
      <li> Traction retinal detachment.</li>
      <li>
      Accidental laser burn of the fovea (a depression in the central macula that contains no blood vessels), resulting in severe central
      vision loss.</li>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;"> Consent for Laser Photocoagulation for Diabetic Retinopathy :</h3>

      The ophthalmologist has explained to me the problem with my eyes, and the risks, benefits, and alternatives to laser photocoagulation.
      Although it is impossible for the doctor to inform me of every possible complication that may occur, the doctor has answered all my
      questions to my satisfaction. I understand that there is no guarantee that the laser will prevent blindness in my eye, and that the laser may
      need to be repeated to effectively treat my condition.<br>
      In signing this informed consent for laser photocoagulation, I am stating that I have been offered a copy and I fully understand the
      possible risks, benefits, and complications of the laser surgery

      I declare that I have explained the nature and consequences of the procedure to be performed, and discussed the risks that particularly concern the patient.
      I have given the patient an opportunity to ask questions and I have answered these.
