      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The scaphoid
      The scaphoid is an important bone in the hand. It is one of the “carpal bones” that joins the hand to the wrist. Your scaphoid is broken. The scaphoid can often be allowed to heal by itself in a plaster or splint. You may have tried this already and it may have been unsuccessful. Alternatively, your surgeon may feel that surgery will give it the best and quickest chance of survival.
<br>
      You should speak to your surgeon about the details of the operation.
      <br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      Fractures at the waist of the bone have an 80-90% chance of healing with rest in a plaster/ splint and not having surgery. If the break is lower down the bone (closer to the wrist) the chance of success drops even lower.
<br>
      You must consider this when opting for surgery and weigh it up against the complications list it below.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt
      afterwards. It is important to discuss this with the staff and
      ask for pain killers if needed. The scar itself can be painful.<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding. Do not be alarmed
      if you see some spotting of blood on the bandage or cast
      that you leave with. If the bleeding becomes any greater,
      then you should contact your doctor or nurse. A collection
      of blood is called a haematoma and this may cause pain
      and may need surgery to remove it. <br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin on the palm.
      These may be painful.  Massaging with moisturiser once
      the wounds have healed is often helpful at softening them
      and decreasing the pain.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature 			            around wound. A course of antibiotics may be
      necessary once the source has been isolated..<br>
      Hypertrophic/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively 		                   		(within the wound margin and beyond respectively). 				They occur in some people and can not be predicted 				although if you have a previous keloid scar you are at 				greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection 				or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under 				            		tension, infected or short of blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Damage to tendons: these run under the wound and can be cut.<br>
      CRP syndrome: this is a disorder which usually happens after surgery or
      other injury. The skin can become very painful – even
      to light touch or movement.<br>
      Non-/delayed union: Despite the fixation, the bone may still not untie. The
      existing metal may need to be removed and the thumb
      re-operated.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
