      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The humerus is your arm bone. It has broken. Your surgeon may have tried to treat the bone by holding it in a brace or plaster and this may not have worked. Alternatively, the surgeon may feel that fixing the bone straight away will give it the best chance of healing. Your surgeon feels that fixing the bone with plate or screws is the best option.<br>

      If you want further information, speak to your surgeons.<br>

      ***please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision, may perform the operation****
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      All broken bones can be left without an operation and treated by resting in a cast. However, they may not set in the right position or may not join at all. Your surgeon believes that your fracture is severe enough to need an operation.<br>
      There are several ways to fix this type of fracture. This form suggests how it may be done, but you should discuss the procedure with your consultant.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure will hurt afterwards. It is important to discuss
      this with the staff and ask for pain killers if needed.
      Keeping the arm up (elevated) in a sling will reduce the
      pain.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin on the back of the elbow.
      You can discuss the length of this with the surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: This may present as redness, discharge or temperature 			           around the wound. A course of antibiotics 				                       may be necessary once the source has been isolated.<br>
      Hypertrophic/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively 		  	     			(within the wound margin and beyond respectively). 				They occur in some people and can not be predicted 				although if you have a previous keloid scar you are at 				greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection 				or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or
      short of blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: 	this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding, but this is
      usually controlled at the time of the operation<br>
      Neurovascular damage: there are many important nerves and blood vessels that
      run through the arm. These can be damaged during the
      operation. This may leave numbness or weakness in the
      muscles below the elbow. This will rarely need another
      operation.<br>
      Delayed/ non-union:	 This may happen because the bone is damaged, the
      bone is poor quality or the bone not adequately.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
