      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The wrist is an important joint. When it has broken, it is important to try and put the bones back into as close to a normal position as possible.
<br>
      Your surgeons therefore feel an operation may be necessary to bring the bones to as normal a position as possible.
      <br>
      ***Please be aware a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      the fracture may be left in its current position in a plaster. If it is not in a good solid position, it may not heal as well. This will make it more likely re-fracturing (rebreaking), arthritis, pain and disability.<br>

      You may of course seek a second opinion.<br>

      There may be other forms of fixation, such as wiring or external fixators. These may not be appropriate for your case. You should discuss these with your consultant.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: your wrist will be sore after the operation. Keeping the arm up (elevated)
      most of the time will help reduce the pain and swelling. We will also give
      you pain killers. If you need more, however, please ask a member of staff.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: unfortunately, even though the surgeon inserts the plate in theatre where
      everything is sterile and your skin is cleaned, there is still a small percent
      of patients who develop an infection. Most infections will present as
      redness, swelling or even a discharge of fluid or pus. A course of antibiotic
      may be needed. If the infection is severe, a further operation including
      removal of plate may be necessary.<br>
      Neurovascular damage: there are numerous blood vessels and nerves that run through
      and around the wrist. This means that they may be damaged by the plate
      as it is put in. This might lead to numbness or weakness of muscles.
      This may be temporary or in very rare cases, permanent.<br>
      Compartment syndrome: this is a build up pressure within the forearm and can cause
      pain, nerve damage, blood vessel damage and muscle damage. If this
      occurs, an emergency operation will have to be performed.<br>
      Slipped position; Despite manipulation, plating and cast application, the fracture may
      very rarely still slip. Further operation may be necessary.<br>
      Removal of plate: This is not usually necessary unless there is infection or severe
      restriction in movement or pain.<br>
      Arthritis- and stiffness at the wrist or elbow may occur despite adequate reduction.
      Arthritis may be more common if the fracture involves the joint.<br>
      CRP syndrome: this is pain, swelling or stiffness around the fracture site and
      may occur even months after the original injury.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
