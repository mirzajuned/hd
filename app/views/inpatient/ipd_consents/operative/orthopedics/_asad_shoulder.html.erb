      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      An arthroscopic procedure is one that is carried out with a small telescope and instruments. The idea is that it usually avoids the use of a big wound to get at the joint and the complications associated with it.
<br>
      You may have pain and a decrease in the movement of your arm at the shoulder joint. You and your surgeon may feel that an arthroscopic decompression is the best operation to try and lessen the pain.
<br>
      A tendon runs through a tunnel in the shoulder blade, but it has been compressed (squashed). This operation releases that tightness (decompresses the tendon).
<br>
      ***Please be note a junior surgeon with adequate training or supervision may perform your operation**
      <br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      Simple pain killers may help you control the pain.
      Your surgeon may have tried or you may be recommended to try steroid/ local anaesthetic injections. These can be very successful at reducing the pain.
<br>
      This procedure can also be carried out as an open procedure. This means making a large cut to get at the shoulder/ sub-acromial area. It means the surgeon can see and get to the area much more easily. However, the complications of an open procedure may be greater and the recovery longer.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt afterwards.
      It is important to discuss this with the staff and ask for pain killers if
      needed. Even after the operation, you may still have pain.<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding. But is usually small in this
      operation. Extremely rarely a large artery or vein may be damaged.
      This may need to have a further operation to stop the bleeding –
      including opening the shoulder up.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave two to three small scars around the shoulder.
      You should discuss the position of these with your surgeon. The
      wounds can sometimes not heal well. This may lead to thickened scars
      or further surgery.<br>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature around the shoulder. A course of antibiotics may be necessary or very rarely
      another operation to wash out the joint.<br>
      Frozen shoulder: A restricted range of movement is sometimes left. Physiotherapy,injections and sometimes further surgery can help.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Thickened/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow. They occur in some people and can not be predicted although if you have a previous keloid scar you
      are at greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection or
      surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or short of
      blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: 	this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Conversion to an open procedure: sometimes, the approach to the shoulder can not be
      reached by the telescope alone and the surgeon may proceed to an open
      operation. This means making a larger cut along the front of the
      shoulder. If you do not wish this to happen, you should discuss this
      with the surgeon.<br>
      Nerve damage: Within the tight area around the shoulder are a number of important
      nerves. These may be damaged by the telescope or the instruments.
      Although if they are spotted as being damaged, the surgeon will try
      and  repair them, they may still not heal. Nerve damage may result in
      muscle weakness or numbness along the arm – or both.<br>
      Tendon damage: the tendons around the joint may also be damaged during the
      operation.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
