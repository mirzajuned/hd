      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      You may have a painful shoulder which has decreased movement. This is usually because of arthritis. You may alternatively have broken the bone.
<br>
      The surgeon has suggested that a half resurfacing of the shoulder joint (called a Copeland sholder) is one way to increase the movement in the shoulder and lessen the pain.<br>
      You should speak to your surgeon about the details of the operation.
<br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than a consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      There are various non-surgical options. You may have explored these already.
<br>
      They include pain control – including tablets or injections with medicines such as ibuprofen or steroids.
<br>
      Physiotherapy – learning exercises or stretches has often been proven successful at preventing the need for surgery.
      <br>
      There may be other surgical options and other types of shoulder replacements available. You should discuss these with your surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt
      afterwards. It is important to discuss this with the staff and
      ask for pain killers if needed. The shoulder may remain
      stiff for some time afterwards.<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding. The drains (if 			  	       present) will limit the amount of collection. If the bleeding 			       is excessive, you may need a blood transfusion.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin scar on the front of the shoulder/
      chest
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">LESS COMMON(1-2%)</h3>
      Dislocation: this is a painful situation where the shoulder moves out of its
      position in the joint. It can usually be repositioned, but if it
      happens regularly, a further operation may be necessary.
        <br>
      Decreased function:  the success of the operation is very variable. You may end up with as much or even worse movement in the shoulder. The
      main purpose of the operation is to reduce your pain.
      <br>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature around the flap or donor site. A course of antibiotics may be necessary once the source has been isolated. The shoulder replacement may also have to be removed and
      replaced. This will certainly require further operations.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Nerve damage : there are a great number of large and important nerves that
      run through and around the shoulder. These may be damaged
      during the operation. This may result in a temporary or more
      permanent loss of power or feeling.<br>
      Hypertrophic/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively(within the wound margin and beyond respectively).They occur in some people and can not be predicted 	although if you have a previous keloid scar you are at 				   greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection 				      or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under
      tension, infected or short of blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: 	this is also a cause of delayed wound healing
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
