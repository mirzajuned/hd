      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      An arthroscopy means “looking into a joint” with a camera. It allows the surgeon to examine the knee joint and perform some operations without having to open the knee completely.
      <br>
      The surgeon might not be able to say exactly what needs to be done until they are looking inside the knee. Therefore the consent form is non-specific. It allows the surgeon to treat most abnormalities found during the operation.
      <br>
      You may be able to drive within a week and may return to work as soon as walking long distances is comfortable. Returning to work naturally depends upon your profession.
      <br>
      You may be told to avoid sport for a period time, but talk to your surgeon after the operation.
      <br>
      ***please be aware that a surgeon other than your consultant but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      If not already done, an MRI scan may be performed. This will however only aid diagnosis of a problem and not treat it.<br>
      Physiotherapy may also be of great benefit.<br>
      The procedure may also be done purely as an open procedure (an arthrotomy). This involves making a larger cut (incision) and opening the knee joint. This is rarely done now because arthroscopy is so successful and has much fewer complications (in/ by comparison).
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Swelling: The knee may fill with fluid or rarer, blood. This usually resolves on its own
      however may occasionally require a second operation or draining of the
      fluid.<br>
      Persistent pain: the symptoms may carry on despite the procedure. A repeat
      arthroscopy or other knee operation may be required.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE: (<1%) </h3>
      Infection: the wound sites may become red, painful and hot. There may also be a
      discharge of fluid. These are signs of infection and can usually be treated by
      antibiotics. Very rarely, the infection may spread to the knee joint itself
      (requiring a washout) and/or the blood (sepsis) requiring intravenous
      antibiotics.<br>
      Damage to structures within  or around the knee: this is rare, but may cause further injury and
      symptoms. This may need further treatment including operation.
      Damaged instruments: these may break within the knee and require an opening of the joint to
      remove them.<br>
      Abnormal wound healing: the scar may become thick, red and painful (keloid scar).
      This is more common in Afro-Caribbeans and Asians. There may also
      be some oozing of clear fluid.<br>
      Numbness: the skin around the knee and shin may be temporarily or more permanently
      numb due to damage of small superficial nerves.<br>
      Blood clots: a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is a blood clot in a vein. These may
      present as red, painful and swollen legs (usually). The risks of
      developing a DVT are greater after any surgery (and especially bone
      surgery). Although they are painful, a DVT can also pass in the blood
      stream and be deposited in the lungs (a pulmonary embolism –PE).
      This is a very serious condition which affects your breathing.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
