      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The hip joint is a “ball and socket joint”. It is a very important joint as it allows a great deal of movement but is also weight-bearing. Your hip is broken and your surgeons recommend it is replaced. In this operation, the ball is replaced, but the cup remains your own bone (this is why it is called a “hemi” [meaning a half] hip operation).
<br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform your operation ***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      there may be other options to fix your broken hip. However, your surgeon’s experience tells them a half-hip replacement is  the best option.<br>
      There are options of half hip you can consider – you should discuss these with your surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Blood clots: a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is a blood clot in a vein. These may
      present as red, painful and swollen legs (usually). The risks of
      developing a DVT are greater after any surgery (and especially bone
      surgery). Although not a problem themselves, a DVT can pass in the blood stream and be deposited in the lungs (a pulmonary embolism –
      PE). This is a very serious condition which affects your breathing.
      Your surgeon may give you medication through a needle to try and
      limit this risk of DVTs from forming. Some centres will also ask you
      to wear stockings on your legs, while others may use foot pumps to
      keep blood circulating around the leg. Starting to walk and getting
      moving is one of the best ways to prevent blood clots from forming.<br>
      Bleeding: this is usually small and can be stopped in the operation. However,
      large amounts of bleeding may need a blood transfusion or iron tablets.
      Rarely, the bleeding may form a blood clot or large bruise around the
      wound which may become painful  require an operation to remove it.<br>
      Pain: the hip will be sore after the operation. If you are in pain, it is
      important to tell staff so that medicines can be given. Pain will
      improve with time. Rarely, pain will be a chronic problem. This may
      be due to altered leg length or any of the other complications listed
      below, or sometimes, for no obvious reason.<br>
      Altered leg length: the leg which has been operated upon, may appear shorter or
      longer than the other. This rarely requires a further operation to correct
      the difference or shoe implants.<br>
      Joint dislocation: if this occurs, the joint can usually be put back into place without
      the need for surgery. Sometimes this is not possible, and an operation
      is required, followed by application of a hip brace or rarely if the hip
      keeps dislocating, a revision operation may be necessary.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">LESS COMMON: (1-2%)</h3>
      Infection: You will be given antibiotics just before and after the operation and the
      procedure will also be performed in sterile conditions (theatre) with     		sterile equipment. Despite this there are still infections (1 to 2½%).          		The wound site may become red, hot and painful. There may also be a     		discharge of fluid or pus. This is usually treated with antibiotics, but an   		operation to washout the joint may be necessary. In rare cases, the      		prostheses may be removed and replaced at a later date. The infection can sometimes lead to sepsis (blood infection) and strong antibiotics	are required.<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE: (<1%) </h3>
      Altered wound healing: the wound may become red, thickened and painful
      (keloid scar) especially in Afro-Caribbean people. Massaging the scar
      with cream when it has healed may help.<br>
      Nerve Damage: efforts are made to prevent this, however damage to the nerves
      around the hip is a risk. This may cause temporary or permanent
      altered sensation along the leg. In particular, there may be damage to
      the Sciatic Nerve, this may cause temporary or permanent weakness or
      altered sensation of the leg.<br>
      Bone Damage: the thigh bone may be broken when the implant (metal replacement) is
      put in. This may require fixation, either at time or at a later operation.<br>
      Blood vessel damage: the vessels around the hip may rarely be damaged. This may
      require further surgery by the vascular surgeons.<br>
      Pulmonary Embolism: A PE is a consequence of a DVT. It is a blood clot that spreads
      to the lungs and can make breathing very difficult. A PE can be fatal.<br>
      Death: this rare complication can occur from any of the above complications.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
