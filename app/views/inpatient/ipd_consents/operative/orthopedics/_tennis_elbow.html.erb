      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      Tennis elbow is a painful condition of the muscles and tendons on the outside of the arm – just at the elbow. Anybody may get “tennis elbow” and not just tennis players.<br>

      This operation tries to stop the pain. You should talk to your surgeon about the details of the operation.
<br>
      ***please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the procedure***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      There are various non-operative treatments available. These include reducing the inflammation (swelling) by simply resting the elbow.  Using an ice pack and pain-killers (such as ibuprofen) is also helpful at this time.
<br>
      A special tennis elbow brace, which can be bought from sports shops has also been successful.
<br>
      Your doctor or surgeon may also recommend a course of physiotherapy – they will teach you exercises to try and strengthen or stretch the forearm muscles or use an ultrasound machine to limit the inflammation (swelling). They can also show you how to avoid irritating or putting stress on the tendons.
<br>
      Finally your surgeon may also recommend a steroid injection into the muscle.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt
      afterwards. It is important to discuss this with the staff and
      ask for pain killers if needed.<br>
      Infection: This may present as redness, discharge or temperature    		                   around the flap or donor site. A course of antibiotics 				       may be necessary once the source/ bug has been found.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Hypertrophic/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively 				(within the wound margin and beyond respectively). 				They occur in some people and can not be predicted 				although if you have a previous keloid scar you are at 				greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection 				or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under 				           		tension, infected or short of blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: 	this is also a cause of delayed wound healing.<br>
      Delayed return to activity:  Your recovery can be variable and you may have to stay
      away from sport/ gardening or other strenuous activity
      for a long period. You will also have to get back to
      normal activity gradually. A course of physiotherapy
      may also be of use after the operation.<br>
      Nerve damage: there are very few major nerves around this area.
      Rarely, you may experience numbness around the scar
      site.<br>
      Decreased function: You may never have as much strength, movement or function
      as you once had.<br>
      Posterolateral Elbow Instability: this results from injury to the ligaments (stabilisers
      of the elbow). It means the elbow feels less stable<br>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
