      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      This is making a cut in the palm to relieve the pressure on a nerve.
<br>
      You should ask your surgeon for a more details of the procedure.
      <br>
      ***Please note a trainee surgeon with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      Carpal Tunnel syndrome can be left alone and observed.<br>
      If it is left for too long, the area supplied by the Median Nerve can become painful, tingling or numb and eventually the muscles will start to waste away.<br>
      If not released in good time, the damage to the median Nerve may be permanent.
      <br>
      Splinting using wrist/ hand splints may be of benefit, as may steroid injection.
      <br>
      Some centres and surgeons can perform the operation using keyhole surgery (endoscopic). Although recovery is quicker and the scar is smaller, there are other complications to this. Discuss this option with your surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain of local anaesthetic: injection of the local anaesthetic will be painful.
      This is the worst part of the procedure and lasts for only a few seconds
      before the hand becomes numb.
      The scar can also become painful and be distressing.<br>
      Bleeding: there may be damage to a vessel causing prolonged bleeding. This 			is usually curtailed at the time of operation.<br>
      Persistent pain, tingling or numbness: may continue in the hand despite 				operation. The procedure may need to be repeated.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">LESS COMMON(1-2%)</h3>
      Persistent weakness of fingers: despite operation.<br>
      Infection: the wound may become red, swollen, hot and painful. There may 			also be a discharge of fluid or pus. Antibiotics are needed to treat the 				infection.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Scar/ keloid (scar): this may grow thickened, red and painful (keloid scar).
      This is more Common in Afro-Caribbean  people.<br>
      Painful wrist: this usually temporary, but may be more prolonged. The wrist
      may also be weak initially, but this usually resolves.<br>
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRP syndrome): this is pain that
      continues long after one would expect and is much
      greater than one would expect after a small scar. There are various
      techniques that are helpful in relieving CRP. These include massage,
      splintage or injection with medicines such as guanethidine and physio-
      therapy.<br>
      Damage to tendons: damage to tendons may cause loss of flexion of those 			fingers/ parts of the hand. This may also require repair.
      Nerve injury: extremely rarely, the median nerve itself can be damaged.
      More likely (but still rare) is injury to the pamlar cutaneous branch. This can leave numbness of the palm or form a painful swelling called a neuroma.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
