      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The tibia is the long shin bone in the lower leg. It is a weight bearing bone and will need to be fixed for you to walk on it. Your surgeons feel that the best way to hold the bone together is to insert a nail through the bone hence holding the two ends together and allow proper bone healing. The tibia bone is essentially a long hollow tube with marrow in the middle. A nail (or metal rod) can pass through the hollow and bridge the two broken pieces.
<br>
      This means you will most likely not have to wear a cast, but you are still advised to not put any weight through the leg for many weeks.
      <br>
      Your surgeon will see you before the operation. The surgeon will mark your leg with a felt pen to make sure the correct leg is operated on. If you have any questions, now might be a good time to ask them.
      <br>
      An anaesthetic will be given in theatre. This can be either a general (when you will be asleep) and/ or a regional (when just one area of your body is numbed). When in the theatre and lying on your back, the foot of your broken leg can be placed in a stirrup or can dangle off the edge of the operating table. The surgeon will clean the leg with anti-septic solution and place clean towels (drapes) around the site.
      <br>
      A small cut (around 3 to 5cm) will be made just below your knee cap. This allows the surgeon to see the top of the tibia. A surgical drill (reamer) can then remove the bone marrow from the middle of the tibia. This will allow a nail to pass down across the break to the other side of the bone and bridge the two ends together. The surgeon will take X-rays at regular intervals to make sure that the position of the nail is correct.
      <br>
      When satisfied, the surgeon may then pass screws into the nail from the side to hold it in position. These are called “inter-locking screws”. These will be put in on the inside of the shin (at the top) and above the ankle.
      <br>
      When the surgeon is happy with the X-ray position of the fracture and the nail, the wounds can be closed. Some surgeons prefer stitches while others use clips (skin staples). Both are equally successful and come down to your surgeon’s experience.
      <br>
      When the anaaesthetic wears off, your leg will sore, this is normal. You will have a bandage across the lower leg. If the pain is excruciating, you must tell some one.
      <br>
      You will have repeat X-rays and a blood test the day after and will be shown how to walk with crutches without putting weight through the affected leg.
      <br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than a consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      When your tibia has been broken it may be advisable to have it fixed. Not fixing may result in non-healing, delayed union or mal-union. All these can cause quite significant disability and long term problems.
<br>
      There may be other options available to treat this fracture; these including external fixation or plating. However, it is the suggestion of the consultant surgeon looking after you that nailing is the best option. You are of course entitled to a second opinion.
      <br>
      There MAY also be a non-operative option. This would be to place the fractured leg in a cast and regularly x-ray to watch the bone healing. You will have to be non-weight bearing and there is a very high risk of non-union (when the bone ends do not fix properly of do not meet at all) in these fractures which may eventually require an operation such as the one above.
      <br>
      NB plaster cast is not appropriate for some fractures.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: There will inevitably be some pain after the operation. This may be
      around the  wound site, the fracture site or at the ankle or knee. If you
      are in pain it is important that you ask for pain killers. Pain will
      decrease over the next few days to weeks as the bone heals and the
      swelling decreases. Very rarely, pain may continue. This may be due to
      failed fixation in which case another operation may have to be
      performed. Pain at the knee is common after the operation.<br>
      Bleeding: There will be some bleeding. This is usually minimal and can be
      stopped at the time of operation. Very occasionally a blood transfusion
      or iron tablets may be necessary<br>
      Infection: the wound site may become red, swollen and painful. There may also be discharge. If this occurs, antibiotics may need to be given. If the
      metalwork becomes involved, it may be removed. There may be spread
      of the infection to bone or blood (sepsis). Again antibiotics may be
      necessary. Extremely rarely, very severe local infections my require
      the leg to amputated.<br>
      Numbness: the skin around the wound sites may be temporarily or more
      permanently numb.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">LESS COMMON(1-2%)</h3>
      Stiffness of the joints around the fracture: may occur and may require vigorous
      physiotherapy<br>
      Stiffness: and osteoarthritis may continue. This may require vigorous
      physiotherapy  and or repeat surgery.<br>
      Fat embolus: the fat in the middle of the bone (marrow) may be spread to the blood
      and  eventually the lungs during manipulation or during the original
      break. This can cause severe breathing problems. Very rarely, this can
      be fatal.<br>
      Blood clots: a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is a blood clot in a vein. These may
      present as red, painful and swollen legs (usually). The risks of
      developing a DVT are greater after any surgery (and especially bone
      surgery). Although not a problem themselves, a DVT can pass in the
      blood stream and be deposited in the lungs (a pulmonary embolism –
      PE). This is a very serious condition which affects your breathing.
      Your surgeon may give you medication through a needle to try and
      limit this risk of DVTs from forming. Some centres will also ask you
      to wears stockings on your legs, while others may use foot pumps to
      keep blood circulating around the leg. Start to walk and getting moving
      is one of the best ways to prevent blood clots from forming.<br>
      Catheterisation: The team may pass a tube into the bladder. This is usually temporary
      but will collect your urine.<br>

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Compartment syndrome: this is a build up pressure within the lower leg and can cause
      pain, nerve damage, blood vessel damage and muscle damage. If this
      occurs, an emergency operation will have to be performed to prevent
      death of tissue of the lower leg/ foot.<br>
      Damage to the skin under the tourniquet: this may require dressing, surgery or skin
      graft. There may also be numbness of the skin under the tourniquet,
      this is usually temporary.<br>
      Failed reduction: this is difficulty in aligning the two ends of broken bone. In this
      case, the operation may need to be repeated or an alternative operation
      may be done at a later date.<br>
      Removal of metalwork: this may be necessary if it becomes infected or painful or
      damages the skin. Sometimes, the nail can be removed to allow greater
      movement once the bone has healed.<br>
      Abnormal wound healing: the scar may become thick, red and painful (keloid scar).
      This is more common in Afro-Caribbean’s.<br>
      Deformity of the leg: the bone may not heal in its intended alignment. This may
      require physiotherapy or further operation (including removal of nail).<br>
      Delayed or non-union of fracture: this is when the bone ends do not join adequately.
      At this point, a bone graft & further surgery may be necessary.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
