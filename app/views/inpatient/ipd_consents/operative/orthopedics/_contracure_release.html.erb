      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      Dupuytren’s contracture is a common condition. In most cases, no cause is found, but it more commonly affects white men of middle age or older. There is also a genetic (family) connection and diabetics are more likely to get it.   However, anyone can be affected.
<br>
      If successful, this operation can relieve the pain and give you a return in function.
      <br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant, but with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      continued physio/ occupational therapy to increase stretching and splinting (especially at night time) may be useful.
<br>
      Early on the disease, injection of the nodules with steroids may also be useful.
      <br>
      However, if the disease has progressed, surgery may be the best option. There are many types of surgical procedure that can be done. You should discuss these with your surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt afterwards.
      It is important to discuss this with the staff and ask for pain killers if
      needed. The scar itself can be painful.<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding. Do not be alarmed if you see some spotting of blood on the bandage or cast that you leave with. If
      the bleeding becomes any greater, then you should contact your doctor
      or nurse.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin on the palm and finger. These may be
      painful.  Massaging with moisturiser once the wounds have healed is
      often helpful at softening them and decreasing the pain.<br>
      Recurrence: the likelihood of Dupuytren’s contracture happening again
      – even in the same hand/ finger are high (around 10%). The harder you
      work with the therapists, the less likely this is.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature around the
      wound. A course of antibiotics may be necessary.<br>
      Thick/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively thick, red and raised. They
      occur in some people and can not be predicted although if you have a
      previous keloid scar you are at greater risk. Scars may be treated with
      steroid injection or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or short of
      blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Damage to tendons: these run under the wound and can be cut.<br>
      CRP syndrome: this is a disorder which usually happens after surgery or other injury.
      The skin can become very painful – even to light touch or movement.<br>
      Numbness: there are important nerves that run along the fingers. These give
      feeling (sensation). They can be attached to the thickenings or can be
      damaged during the operation. This may leave you with numbness of
      the fingers or hand or occasionally some weakness.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
