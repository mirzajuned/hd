      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The elbow is a hinge joint. The olecrenon is the upper part of the ulna (a forearm bone) and is a part of this hinge joint. Your olecrenon is broken. Your surgeons have recommended that you have the olecrenon fixed.<br>

      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant with adequate training or  supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      all broken bones can be left without an operation and treated by resting in a cast. However, they may not set in the right position or may not join at all. Your surgeon believes that your fracture is severe enough to need an operation.<br>
      There are several ways to fix this type of fracture. This forms suggests how it may be done, but you should discuss the procedure with your consultant.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure will hurt afterwards. It is important to discuss this with
      the staff and ask for pain killers if needed. Keeping the arm up
      (elevated) in a sling will reduce the pain.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin on the back of the elbow. You can
      discuss the length of this with the surgeon.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature 	around the
      wound. A course of antibiotics may be necessary once the source has
      been isolated.<br>
      Thick/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively (within the wound margin
      and beyond respectively). They occur in some people and can not be
      predicted although if you have a previous keloid scar you are at greater risk. Scars may be treated with steroid injection or surgically if
      necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or short of
      blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: 	this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding, but this is usually controlled at the time of the operation<br>
      Neurovascular damage: there are many important nerves and blood vessels that run past the elbow. These can be damaged during the operation. This may
      leave numbness or weakness in the muscles below the elbow. This will
      rarely need another operation.<br>
      Delayed/ non-union:	 This may happen because the bone is damaged, the bone is poor quality or the bone not adequately.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
