      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The knee cap is an important part of the structure of your knee. It is essential in allowing the bend of the knee because your thigh muscles attach onto it. Your patella (knee cap) is broken & your surgeons have recommended that you have it fixed with wires. The wires will help to hold the bones in place while they heal.
<br>
      ******Please be aware that a surgeon other than the consultant with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation for you*****
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      all broken bones can be left without an operation and treated by resting in a cast. However, they may not set in the right position or may not join at all. Your surgeon believes that your fracture is severe enough to need an operation.<br>
      There are several ways to fix this type of fracture. This form suggests how it may be done, but you should discuss the procedure with your consultant.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure will hurt afterwards. It is important to discuss with the
      staff and ask for pain killers if needed. Keeping the leg up (elevated)
      on a frame or even a footstool will reduce the  pain and swelling.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin scar down the middle of the knee. You
      can discuss the length of this with the surgeon.<br>
      Backing out of wires: the wires used to hold the broken bones in position have a habit
      of “backing out”. If they start to irritate the skin or cause infection,
      they can be easily removed. The wires can also become prominent.<br>
      Stiffenss: the knee may not move as freely as it did before. You may require physiotherapy to regain that movement.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE: (<1%) </h3>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature 			           around the wound. A course of antibiotics may be necessary once the
      source has been isolated.<br>
      thick/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively (within the wound margin
      and beyond respectively). Scars may be treated with steroid injection
      or surgically if necessary.<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or short of
      blood supply.<br>
      Fat necrosis: this is also a cause of delayed wound healing<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding, but this is usually controlled at
      the time of the operation<br>
      Neurovascular damage: there are no major nerves and blood vessels that run past
      the kneecap. However, the cut may lead to numbness at the front of the
      knee. Also an important nerve called the peroneal nerve which wraps
      around one of the shin bones can also be damaged, leading to
      weakness/ numbness of the foot. This is extremely rare.<br>
      Delayed/ non-union:	This may happen because the bone is damaged, the bone is
      poor quality or the bone not adequately fixed. Sometimes we are not
      sure why the bone doesn’t heal. It may require another operation in the
      future.<br>
      DVT/ Blood clot: A DVT (deep vein thrombosis) is a blood clot that forms in the
      blood vessels. It can be very sore and if the clot travels to the lungs, it
      can seriously affect your breathing.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
