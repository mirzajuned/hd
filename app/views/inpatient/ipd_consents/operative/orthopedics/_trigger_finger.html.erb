      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      You have noticed that you finger doesn’t open or close freely. Instead it catches and snaps open after a lot of effort. Your surgeon feels that you have what is called a “trigger finger” or tenosynovitis. You may have come to a joint decision to have this released.
<br>
      You should speak to your surgeon about the details of the opeation.
      <br>      ***Please note a trainee surgeon with adequate training or supervision may perform the operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      There are few non-surgical treatments with proven success rates for trigger finger. Injection with cortisone steroid is one.<br>

      Resting the affected finger and hoping the inflammation goes down is another treatment.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      As with all procedures, this carries some risks and complications.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain of local anaesthetic: injection of the local anaesthetic (if used) will be painful. This is the worst part of the procedure and lasts for only a
      few seconds before the hand becomes numb.<br>
      The scar can also become painful and be distressing.<br>
      Bleeding: there may be damage to a vessel causing prolonged bleeding. This 			is usually stopped at the time of operation. You may some spotting on your
      bandage.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE(<1%)</h3>
      Infection: the wound may become red, swollen, hot and painful. There may 			also be a discharge of fluid or pus. Antibiotics are needed to treat the 				infection.<br>
      Scar/ keloid (scar): this may grow thickened, red and painful (keloid scar).
      This is more Common in Afro-Caribbean  people.<br>
      Painful wrist: this usually temporary, but may be more prolonged. The wrist
      may also be weak initially, but this usually resolves.<br>
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRP syndrome): this is pain that
      continues long after one would expect and is much
      greater than one would expect after a small scar. There are various
      techniques that are helpful in relieving CRP. These include massage,
      splintage or injection with medicines such as guanethidine and physio-
      therapy.<br>
      Damage to tendons: damage to tendons may cause loss of flexion of those 			fingers/ parts of the hand. This may also require repair.<br>
      Nerve injury: extremely rarely the digital nerve itself can be damaged.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
