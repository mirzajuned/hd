      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      The ankle is a hinge joint and it mostly allows your foot to go up and down. Unfortunately, you have broken your ankle. As a result of this, your ankle is very unstable and your surgeons think that without an operation to hold the bones while they heal it is unlikely to gain the maximum stability you need to walk.
      <br>
      ***Please be note a junior surgeon with adequate training or supervision may perform your operation***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      When the ankle has been badly broken like this, the ligaments which hold the ankle in position may also be torn. That means the ankle is unstable and fixing may be the best option. You are of course entitled to a second opinion.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: your ankle will be painful after the operation. Keeping it up will help
      decrease the swelling and therefore the pain. In some rarer cases, the
      pain may be long term.<br>

      Numbness: the skin around ankle may be temporarily or more permanently
      numb due to damage to small nerves.<br>
      Stiffness: and osteoarthritis may continue. This may require vigorous
      physiotherapy and or repeat surgery.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(1-2%)</h3>
      Repeat surgery: this may be necessary as the swelling at time of initial operation
      maybe too great to proceed.<br>
      Removal of metalwork: this may be necessary if it becomes infected or painful or
      damages the skin. Similarly, the metalwork can be removed for better
      comfort and movement. If a special screw (called a diastasis) is placed,
      this is usually removed around 12 weeks after the initial operation.
      Otherwise, it is not normal to remove the metalwork.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE: (<1%) </h3>
      Infection: the wound site may become red, swollen and painful. There may also
      be discharge. If this occurs, antibiotics may need to be given. If the
      metalwork becomes involved, it may be removed. There may be spread
      of the infection to bone or blood (sepsis). Again antibiotics may be
      necessary.<br>
      Bleeding: may occur if there is damage to a vessel. This is usually  minimal and
      can be stopped at the time of operation. Very  occasionally a blood or
      iron tablets may be necessary.<br>
      Abnormal wound healing: the scar may become thick, red and painful (keloid
      scars ). This is more common in Afro- Caribbean people.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
