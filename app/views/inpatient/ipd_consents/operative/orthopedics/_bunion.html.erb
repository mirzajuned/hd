      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Procedure</h3>
      You may have noticed that your big toe (and possibly other toes) is pointing outwards – this is called a Hallux valgus. A bunion is the part of the big toe wish protrudes (sticks) inwards.
<br>
      The big toe may even be turned, pushing outwards and be rubbing against the shoe or another toe. This can be painful and you may have come to a joint decision with your surgeon to have the deformity corrected by an operation.
      <br>
      ***Please be aware that a surgeon other the consultant, but with appropriate training or supervision may perform the procedure***
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Alternate Procedure</h3>
      All bunions can be left without any operation worsening symptoms such as pain, infections and inflammation are reasons for operation. Wearing large wide toed, flat shoes can often decrease symptoms.
<br>
      There are numerous operative procedures that can be performed. The one suggested by your surgeon may be the most appropriate for your case or the surgeons preferred technique. You can of course seek another opinion.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Risks</h3>
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">COMMON(2-5%)</h3>
      Pain: the procedure does involve moving soft tissue and will hurt afterwards.
      It is important to discuss this with the staff and ask for pain killers if
      needed.<br>
      Bleeding: there will inevitably be some bleeding.<br>
      Scar: the operation will leave a thin scar on the side (or top) of the big toe.<br>
      Joint stiffness: this may occur after the operation and although not painful, may mean that the bend at the toe is less.<br>
      Laxity at the toe: the operation may damage the ligaments and tendons of the joint
      making the toe joint unstable.
      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">RARE: (<1%) </h3>
      Infection: This is may present as redness, discharge or temperature 	around the
      flap or donor site. A course of antibiotics be necessary once the source
      has been isolated. If   there were any wires inserted or other metal
      work these may need to be removed sooner.<br>
      Delayed bony union: despite fixation, the bones sometimes do not join properly. A
      second operation may be necessary.<br>
      Thick/ keloid scar: These are scars which grow excessively (within the wound margin
      and beyond respectively).<br>
      Delayed wound healing: may occur if the wound is under tension, infected or short of
      blood supply.<br>
      Recurrent deformity: The deformity may return despite the fixation.<br>
      Fracture: during the operation, the bones are “broken” (an osteotomy) and then
      repositioned. As they start to heal, they are weak and may re-break
      (fracture). This can be painful and may require another  operation.

      <h3 style="font-size: 15px!important;">Confirmation of consent :</h3>
      I have read/ understand the procedure, risks and complications. I have asked any questions and raised any immediate concerns I might have. I understand another surgeon other than my consultant may perform the operation.(although they will have adequate training/ supervision).<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure<br>
      <b>I understand</b> that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

      If you have any complaints about your treatment or your care, you are always encouraged to discuss them with your surgical team.
      <br>
      However, if you wish to complain to the trust, each hospital will have a PALS or Patient Advise and Liaison Service. The head nurse on the ward or out patients’ clinic can direct you to them. The PALS team will treat all complaints seriously.
