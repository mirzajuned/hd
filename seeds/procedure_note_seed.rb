#     { name: "Cataract Surgery by Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implant", proceduretext: "TITLE OF OPERATION: Extracapsular cataract extraction, right eye, by phacoemulsification with implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Slow, painless decreased vision, right eye, secondary to cataract formation, interfering with the patient's ability to perform daily activities. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cataract, right eye, with impaired function. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cataract, right eye, with impaired function. ANESTHESIA: Local with intravenous sedation. DESCRIPTION: Anesthesia was induced with peribulbar injection. Following onset of anesthesia and akinesia, the patient was prepared and draped for ophthalmic surgery. A wire lid speculum was placed in the right eye. Clear-corneal wound was made with a 3.2-mm keratome. Viscoelastic was injected into the anterior chamber to deepen it, and an anterior capsulotomy performed with a capsulorrhexis technique. The nucleus was hydrodissected with balanced salt solution and emulsified with the phacoemulsification device. The remaining cortex was removed using irrigation and aspiration. Additional viscoelastic was reintroduced into the anterior chamber to deepen it. The posterior chamber intraocular lens was inspected and irrigated with balanced salt solution. Using a smooth lens forceps the intraocular lens is introduced into the eye and placed in the appropriate position. Following rotation, it was noted to be well centered and well positioned with the loop in the horizontal position. The viscoelastic was removed using irrigation and aspiration. The anterior chamber was deep and well formed with a well-centered intraocular lens. The wire lid speculum was removed from the eye which was then dressed with topical antibiotic and steroid drops followed by a patch and shield. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room in alert and stable condition. " },
#     { name: "Extracapsular cataract extraction with lens implantation", proceduretext: "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:Cataract. ANESTHESIA: Local. DESCRIPTION: The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position. After adequate local anesthesia was achieved, the face was prepared and draped in the usual fashion. A lid speculum was placed between the lids. A stay suture of 4-0 black silk was placed beneath the insertion of the superior rectus muscle and the eye retracted downward. A peritomy was then performed from the 9 o'clock to the 3 o'clock position at the limbus. Hemostasis was achieved using biopolar cautery. A groove was then made from the 10 o'clock to the 2 o'clock position using a Beaver blade. The anterior chamber was entered at the 12 o'clock position using a Supersharp blade. The anterior chamber was reformed using Healon. An anterior capsulotomy was then performed using a bent 30-gauge needle. The wound was then opened to its entire extent using straight corneoscleral scissors. Lens nucleus was expressed without complication. Previously placed 8-0 black silk sutures were temporarily tightened and tied. Irrigation and aspiration tip was entered into the anterior chamber and the cortical remnants were removed. The intraocular lens was then inserted without complication. The previously placed 8-0 black silk sutures were permanently tightened, tied and cut. The pupil came down nicely and was round. The wound was secured using multiple simple placed 10-0 nylon stitches at 11 o'clock, 1 o'clock. These sutures were tightened, tied and cut. The patient received subconjunctival injection of Decadron and Gentamicin. The stay suture and the lid speculum was removed. The eye was dressed and patched. The patient was returned to the recovery room, having tolerated the procedure well without complication. " },
#     { name: "Laeral rectus recession Squint surgery", proceduretext: "TITLE OF OPERATION: Strabismus surgery with recession of lateral rectus muscle INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Outward deviation / divergent squint of eye PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Divergent squint. ANESTHESIA:Local with intravenous sedation. PREPARATION: Prepared and draped in the usual sterile manner. DESCRIPTION: After appropriate draping, a lid speculum was placed between the lids of the right eye. An incision was made superotemporally to expose the lateral rectus muscle. This was hooked with a muscle hook and secured with 6-0 Vicryl sutures and disinserted from the globe. It was reattached to the globe in hang-back, adjustable suture fashion, recessing it from the original insertion. A 5-0 Mersilene suture was placed for traction purposes during the adjustment process. Conjunctiva is closed with 6-0 Vicryl sutures. Subconjuntival injection of Decadrone and Gentamicin given. Eye speculum removed. Pad and bandage of the eye done  The patient was returned to her room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well." }
